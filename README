% o SLJCompact is a Matlab based program that computes the band diagram and current-voltage characteristics  %
%   of semiconductor photoanodes.  To enable rapid insights, corresponding to various semiconductor-liquid   %
%   junction (SLJ) properties and observable current-voltage characteristics, an abridged set of semi-       %
%   analytical conservation equations are employed in the semiconductor region coupled with Gouy-Chapman     %
%   screening within the liquid region.  Electrostatic interactions between these regions across the         %
%   junction are solved self-consistently through a variation on the Scharfetter-Gummel method.   In this    %
%   manner, the model is able to provide key band diagram insights regarding the correlated operation of     %
%   photoanodes, both under illumination and in the dark, with respect to: current-voltage trends,           %
%   quasi-Fermi level splitting, hole transfer rates, electron transfer rates, depletion region screening,   %
%   hole inversion screening, and carrier recombination lifetimes.  Motivated by Kroemer's lemma, SLJCompact %
%   is intended to further the adoption of band diagram methods within the photoelectrochemical device       % 
%   literature, by providing a computationally inexpensive approach residing between computationally         %
%   intensive full continuity equation solvers and more approximate analytical expressions.                  %
% o Documentation for an example run is provided after this preamble.                                        %

% Within the main downloaded folder tree, associated with the software package, there are two subfolders and %

% that typically takes a serveral minutes or so to run on a modern laptop.  All parameter settings for these %
% examples are provided in the Supplemental Material. For these two particular runs, the main parameters of  %
% interest are the hole transfer rate constant and carrier lifetime, set at 10/s and 10e-8 s, respectively   %
% The results of these two runs can be viewed by executing the provided plotting script in the manner of     %
